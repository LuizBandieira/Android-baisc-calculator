## Simple Android calculator

This simple calculator can do the four basic operations and keeps an operations history.

This project is targeted at someone trying to get into the real basics of Android development. 

There isn't much happening here, but there is a pretty decent communication between two screens without the use of singletons.

### How to build?

#### Using gradle:

Open any terminal in the Calculator (root) folder.

Execute the command ".\gradlew assembleDebug".
**PS:** If you have gradle in your PATH, you can use only "gradlew assembleDebug".

After that, a new .apk file will be generated in the /app/build/outputs/apk folder.

```
This app was developed using Android Studio, therefore I recommend using it for any relevant
changes you might wanna make to the app.
